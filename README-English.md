[![Reservia logo](/images/Reservia-logo.png "Watch Reservia prototype")](https://thomas-savigner.github.io/01_OpenClassrooms_Reservia/)


## Scenario
_I started my first internship as a web developer at Reservia, a small company offering a vacation planning tool._

_Their site allows users to find accommodation and activities in the city of their choice. The accommodations can also be filtered by theme, for example their budget or their atmosphere._

_My manager, Sarah, CTO of the company, entrusts me with the first task of developing a site. I will cut and integrate the models from scratch and using only HTML for the structuring and content of the site and CSS to define the style._

_She also sends me the specifications and outlines the start of the project._<br/><br/><br/>


## Technical constraints
- _From the desktop and mobile models, create the page, without developing the functionalities, in smartphone and desktop version, free tablet version._
  
   _Responsive:_
  
     - _Set appropriate media queries breakpoints._
     - _Use Flexbox rather than CSS Grid for the arrangement of elements on the style sheet._
- _Frameworks and pre-compilers like Sass are prohibited, the page must be written from scratch only with HTML and CSS. The code will use semantic tags and will need to be submitted to W3C validators._
- _The page will be compatible with the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox browsers._
- _The code will be versioned with Git and a remote repository hosted on GitHub or GitLab. The page will be deployed to GitHub Pages or GitLab Pages._<br/><br/><br/>


## Resources Provided
- _The images are available in different formats: choose and adapt the format combining a compromise between resolution and loading time._
- _Icons are from Font Awesome library._
- _The colors of the graphic charter:_

    - _Primary: one blue (#0065FC)_
    - _Secondary: the same blue in a lighter version (#DEEBFF)_
    - _Tertiary: a gray for the background (#F2F2F2)_
- _The font of the site is Raleway._<br/><br/><br/>

## models
_These were made by the UI designer of Reservia, he used the principles of Material Design._<br/>
